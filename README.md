# Introduction
A small effort to learn to build a mini-GPT model in pytorch. This model is trained on the books dataset. It's a simple character level prediction model.

# File Structure
1. The training code is available in training.py
2. The books used to train this model are available in data folder.
   
# How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a virtual enviornment.
3. Download packages from requirement.txt
4. python training.py

# Future Work
1. Modify the tokenzier to Byte-pair tokenizer.
2. Improve the generation process by taking text instead of a random number.
